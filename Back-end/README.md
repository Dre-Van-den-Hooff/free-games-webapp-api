# Free Games API
To get started with this API, create a `.env` file in the root folder with the following content:

```
NODE_ENV="development" 
DATABASE_USERNAME="root" 
DATABASE_PASSWORD=""
DATABASE_HOST="localhost" 
DATABASE_PORT=3306
````
Make sure the username and password credentials match with those of your local database.

**Note: The host and port are optional, you can change them here if you use different ones than the default.**

## How to start 
In the project directory, run `yarn start` to start the API.

## Errors
